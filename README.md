🧱 How to Set Up a Minecraft Java Server
Welcome to this guide! I created this repository to help anyone who wants to set up their own Minecraft Java Edition server. The idea came from a friend who asked me how to do it—so I decided to write everything down and share it here for others too.
🎯 What You'll Find Here
- Step-by-step instructions to set up a Minecraft Java server
- Tips for configuring server settings
- Advice on port forwarding and firewall setup
- How to invite friends to join your server
- Optional mods and plugins setup
🛠 Requirements
- A computer with Java installed
- A stable internet connection
- Basic knowledge of command line (helpful but not required)
🚀 Getting Started
- Download the official Minecraft server .jar file from minecraft.net.
- Create a folder for your server and place the .jar file inside.
- Run the server using the command:
java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui
- Accept the EULA by editing eula.txt.
- Customize server.properties to your liking.
- Set up port forwarding on your router to allow friends to connect.
- Share your public IP address with your friends (or use a service like DynDNS).
📦 Optional: Mods and Plugins
If you want to enhance your server, check out options like:
- Spigot or Paper for performance and plugin support
- Forge for modding
🙌 Why I Made This
My friend asked me how to set up a Minecraft server, and I realized a lot of people might be wondering the same thing. So I put together this guide to make it easier for anyone to get started.
